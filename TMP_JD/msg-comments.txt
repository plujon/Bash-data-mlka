### (MSG-001) HUGH: Moved all variables to the global-vars.bash file
###                 so that other scripts will have access to all variables:
###
###

### (MSG-001-B) HUGH: We can use global functions like this:
###
###

### (MSG-001-C) HUGH: the function can be called and used just like echo
###                   except the function does all the work. Much cleaner
###                   when reading the script.
###

### (MSG-002) HUGH: The above was replaced with more readable code below:
###
###

### (MSG-003) HUGH: You had mentioned you would like to have an indicator for each file moved.
###
###

### (MSG-003-B) HUGH: This is an example of Bash functions in action with SafeMove.

### (MSG-008) HUGH: The displaying of the table is handed off to a function
###                 called DisplayTable. Does not fully work at the moment.
### row 1:
### $COLUMN_ARRAY_1[1], $COLUMN_ARRAY_2[1], $COLUMN_ARRAY_3[1], $COLUMN_ARRAY_4[1]
### row 2:
### $COLUMN_ARRAY_1[2], $COLUMN_ARRAY_2[2], $COLUMN_ARRAY_3[2], $COLUMN_ARRAY_4[2]
### A simple for loop could list the entire table...
